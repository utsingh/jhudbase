<!-- First we'll use php to query dbase, then we'll use html and CanvasJS to
     render a chart built from the data returned to use from dbase.
     See CanvasJS documentation, including other chart options at
     https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/basics-of-creating-html5-chart/   -->

<?php
	//open a connection to dbase server 
	include 'open.php';

	//construct an array in which we'll store our data
	$dataPoints = array();

	//we'll soon see how to upgrade our queries so they aren't plain strings
	$sql = "CALL LowestMalaria;";

	//execute the query, then run through the result table row by row to
	//put each row's data into our array
	if ($result = mysqli_query($conn,$sql)){
	   foreach($result as $row){
	      array_push($dataPoints, array( "label"=> $row["country"], "y"=> $row["malaria_incidence"]));
	   }
	}
	
	//close the connection opened by open.php since we no longer need access to dbase
	$conn->close();
